<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>However you know me, or however you found me, I’m glad you are here.</p>

<p>I have been a Chief Information Officer for a long time and it's clear that “managing information” is just the price of entry.  In today's world I think CIO must mean “Chief Innovation Officer”.  Managing innovation buys you a seat at the head table.</p>

<p>My ambition is to find ways in which technology and innovation can be leveraged for more effective, more engaging, more sustainable, and more exciting business growth.</p>

<p>Some examples I am interested are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harnessing the consumerization of enterprise technology</li>
  <li>Encouraging data “curation” and ownership in a large, diverse corporate enterprise</li>
  <li>The social enterprise, ideas and how they propagate and mass collaboration</li>
  <li>Social brand development, social capital and online reputation</li>
  <li>Frictionless security - i.e. security that will not be actively resisted by employees</li>
  <li>Development approaches that are rapid, iterative & nimble</li>
  <li>Open source, transparent, collaborative, “hive” development</li>
  <li>Scale computing in all forms, shapes and sizes (Cloud, Software as a Service, Platform as a service, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Little More on Me - the Personal Side</h2>

<p>I’ve been happily married to Julie for over twenty-two years, and have I have two children, Matt and Elise, who make me very proud.  Julie and I met at UCLA where she was in Pi Beta Phi and I was in Lambda Chi Alpha.  Go Bruins!</p>

<p>My favorites movies are Princess Bride and Dead Poets Society.  I actually have "Carpe Diem" imprinted on my custom iPad cover!</p>

<p>I love driving/riding anything with a motor and enjoy both dirt and street motorcycing and yes I probably go too fast.  I generally love anything outdoors.  Seems I have really gotten into hiking lately.  I appreciate a good 10-15 mile summit hike and have hit most of the local southern California peaks.  It's good to get your heart rate up for 4-8 hours!</p>

<p>My favorite place on earth is Hawaii, so a big mahalo to all of you who feel the same way.  There is no place else where I can literally step off the plane and feel the weight lift from my shoulders and my spirit open up.</p>

<h2>Technical Details About This Site</h2>

<p>We are all standing on the back of giants and I am constantly amazed at the quality and diversity of tools available.  I love learning and using new technology, and I am a generally curious person, so I am always interested in what technologies others use to create sites - so I thought I might share what tools I am using.</p>

<p>While this site is very simple in some ways in others it serves as my classroom and testbed.  It is basically a static site built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">S3/CloudFront</a>.  Since I am using the Cloudfront CDN I have good delivery performance globally.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown and Liquid converters, and creates a complete, ready-to-publish static website. This simplicity keeps it very reliable and also very secure.  This is a great lesson for corporate sites - the simpler the architecture the easier it is to secure and operate.</p>

<p>Here is a quick list of what I am currrently using:</p>

<!-- <p>It starts to become more complex as we did a bit deeper.  Jekyll is built on <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and uses the Ruby packaging system called <a href="http://rubygems.org/pages/download">RubyGems.</a>  Jekyll is built on a number of components such as <a href="">pygments</a> for syntax highlighting.</p> -->
