<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>However you know me, or however you found me … I’m glad you are here.</p>

<p>Some of you you knew me way back in my earliest days, as the wanna be rock star who's first concert was Black Sabbath with my best friend Greg, or riding motorcycles with Jeff, or receiving a full cooler of beer from my friend Matt's Mom and being told "have fun" in high school.

Some of you may know me from UCLA, or from other activities</p>

  poet who follows a literary genius named Henry David Thoreau. You know, this guy:</p>

<blockquote>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</blockquote>

<h2>A Little More on Me - the Personal Side</h2>

<p>I’ve been happily married to Julie for over twenty-two years, and have I have two children, Matt and Elise, who make me very proud.</p>

<p>My favorite place on earth is Hawaii, so a big mahalo to all of you who feel the same way.  There is no place else where I can literally step off the plane and feel the weight lift from my shoulders and my spirit open up.  I love driving/riding anything with a motor and enjoy both dirt and street motorcycing and the outdoors and have really gotten into hiking lately.</p>

<p>If you poke around here, you’ll notice that I have a sincere passion for life!and believe in Carpe Diem — which ultimately means that I belong in the Dead Poet’s Society.</p>

<h2>Technical Details About This Site</h2>

<p>We are all standing on the back of giants and I am constantly amazed at the quality and diversity of tools available.  I love learning and using new technology, and I am a generally curious person, so I am always interested in what technologies others use to create sites - so I thought I might share what tools I am using.</p>

<p>While this site is very simple in some ways in others it serves as my classroom and testbed.  It is basically a static site built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">S3/CloudFront</a>.  Since I am using the Cloudfront CDN I have good delivery performance globally.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown and Liquid converters, and creates a complete, ready-to-publish static website. This simplicity keeps it very reliable and also very secure.  This is a great lesson for corporate sites - the simpler the architecture the easier it is to secure and operate.</p>

<p>It starts to become more complex as we did a bit deeper.  Jekyll is built on <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and uses the Ruby packaging system called <a href="http://rubygems.org/pages/download">RubyGems.</a>  Jekyll is built on a number of components such as <a href="">pygments</a> for syntax highlighting, and this can get complex fast.</p>
