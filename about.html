<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>However you know me, or however you found me … I’m glad you are here.</p>

<p>Some know me as the guy who's very first concert was with my best friend Greg a'</p>

<p>… or if you knew me way back in my early days, as the aspiring rock star who's first concert was Black Sabbath with my best friend Greg, or riding motorcycles with Jeff, or receiving a full cooler of beer from my friend Matt's Mom and being told "have fun".




  poet who follows a literary genius named Henry David Thoreau. You know, this guy:</p>

<blockquote>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</blockquote>

<h2>A Little More on Me - the Personal Side</h2>

<p>My name is Brian Gardner and I created this site. If you spend enough time around here, you’ll notice that I have a sincere passion for life. I’ve been happily married to Shelly for over a decade, and have a son named Zach.</p>

<p>Among the things that I really enjoy doing are traveling and listening to music such as Tori Amos, The Sundays and The Dave Matthews Band. I’ve always been a contemplative person, and believe in Carpe Diem — which ultimately means that I belong in the Dead Poet’s Society.</p>

<p>7 years ago I had the urge to start a blog. At the time, I wasn’t happy with the way themes were designed, so I took matters into my own hands. It started out as a freelance business and became a company called StudioPress.</p>

<p>We developed the Genesis Framework, which Mashable calls the “best of the best” among WordPress frameworks. Because WordPress and Genesis are 100% GPL-licensed, the development communities in both are flourishing.</p>

<h2>Technical Details About This Site</h2>

<p>As a technologist I love learning and using technology and I am a generally curious person so I am interested in what technologies others use and thought I might share what I am using.  We are all standing on the back of giants and I find it very exciting </p>

<p>While this site is very simple in some ways in others it serves as my classroom and testbed.  It is basically a static site built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">S3/CloudFront</a>.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website. This simplicity keeps it very reliable (few points of failure) and also very secure.  This is a great lesson for corporate sites - the simpler the architecture the easier it is to secure and operate.</p>

<p>It starts to become more complex as we did a bit deeper.  Jekyll is built on <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and uses the Ruby packaging system called <a href="http://rubygems.org/pages/download">RubyGems.</a>  Jekyll aslo is built on a number of components such as <a href="">pygments</a> for syntax highlighting, </p>



<p>Source code and content is managed on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></p>
<p>Site performance and uptime is monitored using Rew Relic/Pingdom</p>
