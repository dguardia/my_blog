> Note: be sure to click on the globe and move the earth around to see different views!

## Technology Stack

* The code is publicly available on Github [here](https://github.com/cambecc/earth).
* It's hosted on Amazon S3 and cached with CloudFlare.
* Development tools/libraries: D3.js, when.js, backbone.js, node.js.
* Data from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/), converted to TopoJSON format, and [National Weather Service](http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/).

## Wow!
