This morning I saw a post on LinkedIn by Bob Sutton who is a Stanford Professor and Co-author of Scaling up Excellence.  He discusses Adobe's move to abolish it's employee stack ranking system.  After the system was eliminated, one Adobe employee noted that a feeling of relief has spread throughout the company because the old annual review system was **“a soul-less and soul crushing exercise.”**

Stack-ranking was popularized by Jack Welch at General Electric _(which has since ended the practice)_.  At GE one of the objectives was to force honesty.  Managers don't always want to have the tough discussion.  Stack ranking forces the discssion betweenn manager and employee to address at least one key question: 'Tell me where I rank and tell me why.'"  Some organizations go even further - terminating employees who fall into the bottom 5-10% each year.  

My personal experience with systems like these is they force employees to play "Game of Thrones" at work.  It doesn't drive teamwork, instead employees act on their best interests.  It creates a culture where people are afraid to be innovative and take risks - because what if they fail? 

I think W. Edwards Deming characterized stack ranking better than I ever could:

> “It nourishes short-term performance, annihilates long-term planning, builds fear, demolishes teamwork, nourishes rivalry and politics.”

### Adobe's Changes:

* No more annual reviews, but managers are expected to have frequent “check-ins” with employees to provide targeted coaching and advice. There is no prescribed format or frequency for these conversations, and managers don’t complete any forms or use any technologies to guide or document what happens during such conversations.
* One of the main goals was to _subtract technology_ from the feedback process.  Adobe didn’t want managers to hide behind forms and computers. Instead, managers should focus on having candid and open conversations with the people they lead.
* Once a year, managers make adjustments in employee compensation. Managers have far more discretion over such decisions than in the past: they have nearly complete authority to allocate their budget among their charges as they see fit. 
* Employees are compensated based on how well they have met their goals - not on the "bell curve".

### Adobe's Results:

* Involuntary departures have increased by 50%.
* Voluntary attrition at Adobe has dropped 30%.
* 78% of employees report that their manager is open to feedback from them, a sizeable improvement over past surveys.
* Eliminated the cost of employee review tracking and management system.
* Saved an estimated 80,000 hours of time from the 2000 managers at Adobe each year, the equivalent of 40 full-time employees. _(although I feel this is suspect assuming managers spend at least as much, and hopefully more, time giving employees informal feedback instead)_

### Takeways

My experience is that if you really want all "A" players you need an approach that motivates them.  

* **A sense of purpose** - what is the mission of the company?
* **Clear goals** - What am I expected to contribute?
* **Linkage of company success to personal success** - People are competive and want to "win".  They want to be on a winning team.
* **Positive feedback** - "A" players are used to positive feedback loops.  They don't respond well to negative feedback loops.  Make sure you tell them how important they are and where and how they are doing well.

Guess what?  This works really well for non-A players as well.
