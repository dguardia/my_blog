The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation just released it's [annual letter](http://www.gatesnotes.com/2015-annual-letter?page=0&lang=en&WT.mc_id=01_21_2015_AL2015-GF_GFO_domain_Top_21).  I have come to look forward to these letters because I find them incredibly inspiring. As I read this year's letter I was simultaneously moved, inspired and awed by the scope of the task they have taken on. They are taking a fifteen year view to the future and making this their mission:

>The lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history. And their lives will improve more than anyone else's.
