I have noticed a security vulnerability on the iPad – fingerprints!  Each time I use my iPad I have to type in my four digit security code.  This leaves four fingerprints telling you very clearly what four digits I use.

Now you only have to guess the order, and there are only 16 possible combinations.  Unless I wipe the screen each time this makes it really easy to hack my iPad if it was lost or stolen.  I think it's time for a longer passcode.

Update: I also added a matte screen saver and this helps quite a bit.
