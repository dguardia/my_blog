## Let's Talk About Open Government First

President Barack Obama, on his first day in office in 2009, signed an executive order stating that all government information that did not have to be kept secret for security or privacy reasons should be made public. The administration also launched the Open Data Initiative to publish government data and the [data.gov](http://www.data.gov/) website to distribute the data.

> My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government. 
> 
>  _- [President Barack Obama, January 21, 2009](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20090121/2009_transparency_memo.pdf)_

Over the past several years huge strides have been made by the "Open Government" movement. Today:

* Citizens and government leaders alike expect government data to be accessible and transparent. 
* Further, 67.9 percent of people surveyed believe that “Government data is the property of taxpayers and should be free to all citizens.” 
* By a margin of three to one people said they are more likely to vote for politicians who champion data transparency.

### It's progressed quicker than we expected

1. The United States Government maintains its [Open Data Policy](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io) on Github! Anyone can fork the policy, edit it, and submit a pull request to have their edits adopted in a fully open and transparent process just like creating open source software. 
2. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published a set of standards ([ISO 37120](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:37120:ed-1:v1:en)) that specifies the relevant metrics for city services and quality of life. This standard will let researchers and citizens evaluate any city based on a uniform set of metrics. Furthermore, ISO 37120 confirms and accelerates the momentum of the open data movement and now provides a common framework within which all cities can participate. It is a gateway to smarter cities (and citizens).
3. Cities have embraced the open government movement and opened up their data to the public. Here are some examples:
    * [Los Angeles City Metrics](https://performance.lacity.org/) and [DataLA (LA Data Portal)](https://data.lacity.org/)
    * [New York City Open Data Portal](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/)
    * [City of Boston Data Portal](https://data.cityofboston.gov/)

### It has a far larger economic potential than we expected

* A report by [McKinsey & Co.](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/open_data_unlocking_innovation_and_performance_with_liquid_information)  suggests that seven sectors alone could generate more than $3 trillion a year in additional value as a result of open data, which is already giving rise to hundreds of entrepreneurial businesses and helping established companies to segment markets, define new products and services, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.
* A [report](http://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/file_archive/insights/ON%20Report_061114_FNL.pdf) by Lateral Economics and the Omidyar Network finds that, by implementing open data policies, G20 countries could increase their cumulative GDP by $13 trillion over the next five years, because open data attracts private infrastructure investment, creates jobs, strengthens tax systems, and fights corruption.

## What Open Data Looks Like

Metrics must be transparent ...

and the underlying datasets supporting the metrics must be publicly available, along with other supporting data.

Platforms have sprung up to support the open government movement. [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/) appears to have market leadership in this space and has a very complete vision of what an open data platform looks like:

## The "Open Data" Corporation

Open Data is fast becoming a defining theme for business. 

* We all know that data is essential for management decision-making and strategic insight.
* Enlightened organizations understand that data is a strategic corporate asset and foundational to operational excellence. 
* Companies understand that internal clarity and efficiency requires "a single version of the truth", and making data accessible is one of the first steps on this journey.
* Integrated data from open sources and social media allows a 360-degree view of customers, suppliers, products and markets and can generate new product ideas.

But how many companies today are committed to truly openly sharing data across the enterprise? Many organizations still behave as if data is a by-product of the systems that generate and use it and nothing more.  The data stays locked into those systems and is inaccessible to those without a seat license.  Many organizations are "shy" about sharing actual business performance data openly with their employees. This breeds mistrust of course.  Departments may not like openly sharing their data and metrics. People like to keep data "under wraps" or hoard it, giving them power in the organization.
 
The idea that unlocking value requires open data, and open data deserves deliberate investment, resources, headcount, and technology support – just like a company’s other corporate assets – is starting to sound like common sense. 

### Leaders are more trusted

We know people are more likely to vote for politicians who who champion data transparency, but guess what? People are also more like to trust and follow leaders who who champion data transparency inside their organizations. 

### Organizations perform better

Open data can, and should be, linked to strategic goals.  Are your organizations goals transparent?  Are the metrics supporting those goals transparent?  Is the actual data of the performance of the company against those goals shared across the firm? 

Too many organizations create grandiose plans and goals that make wonderful slideware.  When it comes to tying them to hard metrics and then rigourously and publicly sharing progress many fall short.  This means inside the organization the "chaos of competing priorities" continues and the company lacks focus and ultimately performance.

### Value is unlocked

* Open data can bring fresh insights into how companies operate and help management identify and eliminate "the sand in the gears" and other barriers to productivity.
* Companies can choose to share proprietary data to create benchmarks that can improve overall industry performance. 
* Using open data, such as customer discussions on social media, companies can refine product requirements and create new products and services. 
* Companies can even consider ways in which to monetize the value of their data. 

### A few words about information security

Yes, "Open Data" sounds like it runs counter to everything we have been taught about information security and the principle of "least priviledge". To be clear, there is information in an organization addressed by privacy laws, HIPAA, PCI and various and sundry other laws and regulations. This data must of course be protected as prescribed - even so, having a record of the datasets involved and who "owns" them is actually useful for both open data purposes (because it makes the fact we have the data, and who owns it, visible even if the dataset itself is not exposed) as well as information security requirements (because security begins with information ownership and knowing who can grant/revoke access to sensitive information).

Lets also keep things in perspective - the vast majority of data in most organizations is simply "internal data" and is not confidential or sensitive. Yet it is information that people need to perform their jobs and often they struggle to find it, or use stale data, because they just don't know where to go or who to contact for the information - sand in the gears of daily operations.  

## Summary

Think about how open data could apply to your business:

* Do you know what the key operational metrics of your company are? 
* How transparent are those metrics?
* Do you know which datasets support those metrics?
* Do you know all the data that is available in your company? Is there a catalog of datasets? 
* Do you know who is _responsible_ for the data (i.e. the data owner or steward)? 
* How accessible is the data? 
* Can data be explicitly shared, and when shared, can the dataset owner/publisher specify the role for each grantee - editor, viewer, etc.?
* If data cannot be shared do we at least know who "owns" or is responsible for it?
* Is it available for download in any reasonable format needed?  
* Is it accessible via an API so your internal developers can work with it?
* Can your organization consume open data from outside sources easily and make it available across the company?
